 <p><h1>Description</h1></p>
 <p>Fried Rice is a very simple yet delicious recipe. This version relies on a ton of fresh vegetables, Beef Liver, and a little bit of oil for crisping it up.</p>
 <p>The added beef liver gives the fried Rice a very nice rich but subtle taste, and this is why it is one of the most popular choices in Nigeria. Though you can also use Shrimp or any protein you’d like.  If you would love to make vegan fried rice, you can omit the Beef liver or Shrimps entirely!</p>
