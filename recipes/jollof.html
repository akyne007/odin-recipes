    <li>Raise the heat to medium. Pour two cups of the blended peppers mix into the pan. Add the curry powder, nutmeg, and bay leaves, then sprinkle in the stock cubes. Mix well with a wooden spoon and allow to cook while stirring occasionally. Cook until the moisture has reduced significantly and the oil has settled on the surface. This will take at least 20 mins.</li>
